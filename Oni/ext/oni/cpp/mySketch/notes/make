apparently there's also a makefile-based system?

# to find out commands relevent to the openframeworks build system use:
make help

# these files control the build process
addons.make
config.make
compile.project.mk

# 
# and this system will scan all available folders under the main directory for
# .cpp files (don't use .c files)
# 
# config: set up paths to ignore
#         or additional paths to search
#         or flags, and other options
# addons: specify which openFrameworks addons to use
